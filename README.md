# BetterPayment Payment Processor for CiviCRM

A SYSTOPIA developed integration of Germany based payment provider
[BetterPayment](https://betterpayment.de/en/). This is an
**IPN implementation**, meaning your donors will be redirected to a separate
form provided by the BetterPayment servers. This has the advantage that none of
the sensitive information (like credit card numbers) will be processed or even
seen by CiviCRM or you server.

Special thanks to [Wisdom Together](https://www.wisdomtogether.com), who funded
the development of the initial version of this extension.

**Disclaimer**: This module has only been tested with credit card payment
methods so far.
